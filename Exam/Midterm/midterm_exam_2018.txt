1 Introduction
==============
a) What is a simulation model?
	A simulation model is something that describes the kinematics and dynamics of a system (i.e. a UAV), 
	which are given as equations of motions. These equations contains parameters which are related to
	elements such as weight (if it is an aircraft), etc. Using a simulation model, it is much simpler, 
	safer and effifient to design, test and tune a controller before implementing it as part of the actual system.

b)  Why is the simulation model usually simplified when designing control laws?
	This often due to the fact that the simplified (i.e. linearized model, state decoubling) resemples the 
	dynamics of the full model, when the system is purturbed with small but realistic inputs (small working range). 
	Model simplifications leads to much simpler implementation of control laws.

2 Coordinate Frames
===================
a) 	This is due to several multiple reasons. For one, when you have an UAV, you want to know how the kinematics
	and forces acts on the body given in body frame, in order to control the system. But at the same time, the
	vehicle is moving relative to earth, and tracking the vehicle is necessary. For this, one need to operate with
	kinematics (pos, vel) in NED frame.

b) 	This is becaue NED frame is fixed on earth, and thereby rotates with earth's rotation. However, inertial frame
	does not rotate, and is absolute. This is so that the obiting objects such as satellites does not need to refer
	to their orbital position relative to moving earth body, but to an absolute inertial coordinate system.

c) 	Given a Gyro with three degrees of freedom, Gimbal lock is something that happens when the two innermost 
	coordinate frames align with each other, causing the sytem to lose it's degrees of freedom. This is also why
	euler angle rotation matrix rotation collapse when pitch is 90 degrees. This leads to division by zero in 
	some elements which leads to unpredictable rotations.

d) 	Crab angle: is given in stability, meaning when i-k plane of vehicle aligns with airspeed vector. Then the crab 
	angle is the angle between ground speed vector and i_body axis. 
	Fligh path angle: angle between ground speed vector and it's horizontal plane projection 
	Angle of attack: is the between i_body and Va in body frame by rotating vehicle along j-axis so that both end up
	in same horizontal plane. 

e) 	Course is angle between North in NED and horizontal projection Vg. Crab is the difference between horizontal 
	projection Vg and horizontal projection i_b  

3 Forces and Moments
====================
a) 	Rudder, aileron, elevators, motor with propeller, you can have other configurations as well, hybrid of rudder and 
	aileron in tail
 
b) 	Lateral states: yaw,yawrate,roll,rollrate,v-velocity 
	Longitudinal states: u,w-velocity,pitch,pitchrate,altitude
	Decoupling the motions makes designing control laws much easier. In normal maneuvers, the lateral and longitudinal er
	weakly coupled, which makes it possible to decouble them.

c) 	Stall happens when angle of attack angle is so high that the vehicle loses lift. 

d) 	This is due to high-pressure, low-pressure aerodynamics of airfoil. The lift vs angle of attack curve is linear for
	small angles. This is since there is laminar flow around the foils for small angles, and this changes to turbulence
	for larger angles.

e) 	Static stability is aircraft's ability to return to steady-state when purturbed from it's nominal due to it's moments. 
	Dynamic stability is about returning to steady-state when disturbance is present, such as wind. First can be seen as a step function, while the other as a sinesoidal function. It's ability to dampen over time.  

4 Linear Design Models
======================
a) 	Given aircraft equations of motion as 
		x_dot = f(x,u)
	Trim condition when
		x_dot* = f(x*,u*)
	Trim condition is when some or all of the states of the aircraft are in a steady-state. Steady climb, constant altitude
	flight, p=q=r=theta=0, etc.

b) 	Same as in 1 b)

c) 	They are set to zero

d) 	Based on longitudinal equations of motions with alpha_rate and pitch rate

5 Autopilot Design Using Successive Loop Closure
================================================	
a) 	It is a method for finding tuning parameter for a complex system. This is by starting with inner most loop of the system,
	and finding tuning parameters given saturation constraints, then design the outer loops successively with bandwidth much 
	smaller than the inner loop and by assuming that the innerloop functions as a proportional gain(in most cases unity gain) 
	for low frequencies. Then the outerloop can be tuned in the same way as the outer loop etc. 


b) 	take-off, climb, altiutude, hold, descend

c) 	bandwidth descreases as phase-margin becomes smaller and smaller due to delay addition of integrators, two intergrators
	in innerloop means 180 deg phase shift, which is in edge of stability. 	

6 Sensors
=========
a)  Accelerometer: linear absolute accerelation in 3 D
	Gyro rate: angular velocity in 3 D
	Magnetometer: Magnetic north, heading
	Airspeed using pitot
	Altitude using pitot
	GNSS for NED position
	


b) 	KF: 
		pros-an optimal estimator, con-processing heavy
	Leunberg observer: 
		pros-much of the processing can be done offline before hand
		con: not as constistent as KF dynamically

c) 	Mass-spring system inside a casing which measures the absulute acceleration, which is the difference between the casing 
	and the inner-mass. The accelaration is proportional to position of inner-mass compared to the casing. This deviation can
	be for instance measured by capacitive distance measurements. 
	KF: y_acc = y_acc + B_acc + w_acc, w~(0,R)
I
d) 	Is used for measuring altitude and airspeed by means of measuring absolute and differential pressure. A membrane inside
	the tube is deflects due to differential pressure in two champers. 

e) 	Not robust against external magnetic disturbances such as from power lines, motors, metal etc.
