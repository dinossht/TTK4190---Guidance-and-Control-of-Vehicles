%% Information 
% This file is only an example of how you can start the simulation. The
% sampling time decides how often you store states. The execution  time
% will increase if you reduce the sampling time.

% Please note that the file "pathplotter.m" (only used in the second part
% of the assignment) shows the ship path during the path following and
% target tracking part of the assignment. It can be clever to adjust the sampling
% time when you use that file because it draws a sketch of the ship in the
% North-East plane at each time instant. Having a small sampling time will
% lead to multiple ship drawings on top of each other. 

% You should base all of your simulink models on the MSFartoystyring model
% and extend that as you solve the assignment. For your own sake, it is
% wise to create a new model and run file for each task.

% The msfartoystyring.m file includes the ship model. You are not allowed
% to change anything within that file. You need to include that file in
% every folder where you have a simulink model based on
% "MSFartoystyring.slx". 

% WP.mat is a set of six waypoints that you need to use in the second part of
% the assignment. The north position is given in the first row and the east
% position in the second row.
